# Product Metrics & Anomaly Analysis

### üß© Overview
This project focuses on analyzing user activity and retention metrics for a **mobile news feed application**.  
Users can browse posts, like them, and interact with the content that matches their interests.  

Two key analytical studies were conducted:  
1. **Retention Rate Analysis** ‚Äî to measure user retention and evaluate the impact of a marketing campaign.  
2. **Anomaly Detection** ‚Äî to investigate a sudden drop in user activity observed on August 24, 2025.

### 1. Retention Rate Analysis (`Retention Rate.ipynb`)
This notebook examines how user engagement changed before and after the **marketing campaign** held on **August 15, 2025**.  
The analysis includes:
- calculation of **DAU** and **Retention Rate (RR)**;
- cohort analysis and **heatmap visualization**;
- comparison between **ads** and **organic** traffic;
- identification of key retention patterns.

**Key Findings:**
- Average day-1 retention ‚âà **33%**;  
- Ads cohort retention = **3.97%**;  
- Organic cohort retention = **29.9%**, with more stable long-term behavior.

### 2. Anomaly Detection (`Search anomalies.ipynb`)
This notebook investigates a **sudden drop in DAU** detected on **August 24, 2025**.  
By comparing user activity across countries and cities, the analysis reveals that the issue was **localized to Russia**,  
specifically to **Moscow** and **Saint Petersburg**, suggesting a **technical failure or incomplete data upload**.

**Key Findings:**
- The anomaly was **not behavioral**, but **regional**.  
- Activity in Moscow and St. Petersburg was missing on the affected date.  
- No gender- or OS-based anomalies detected.

### Summary
- Marketing campaigns may lead to short-term traffic spikes but weak retention.  
- Organic users show higher and more stable engagement.  
- The DAU anomaly on August 24, 2025 was caused by **localized data loss or access issues** in major Russian cities.

### Usage
All project materials are available for review only.  
No database connection is required to explore the analysis.

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks (`Retention Rate.ipynb` and `Search anomalies.ipynb`) to review the SQL logic, visualizations, and conclusions.  
2. PDF versions of the notebooks are also available for quick viewing (`Retention Rate.pdf`, `Search anomalies.pdf`).  
3. No code execution is needed ‚Äî the notebooks are fully self-contained and illustrate the analytical workflow.
